      <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl mb-6">I recently graduated from University of Saint Louis Tuguegarao, and I love building clean, thoughtful web experiences that feel as natural as the world around us.</p> 
      <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl mb-6">I am a Frontend Engineer and UI/UX Designer with a passion for creating intuitive and engaging user interfaces. My journey in web development has been driven by a desire to blend aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that every interaction is seamless and enjoyable.</p> 
      <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl">When I'm not designing or coding, you'll find me writing poems, taking pictures of nature, or curating playlists â€” things that inspire the rhythm and calmness I bring into my work.</p>
